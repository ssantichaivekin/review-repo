## Geography

A student at Harvey Mudd College, California. Comes from Bangkok, Thailand.

### Reading

My favorite books are :
- *The Prophet* by Kalil Gibran
- *Why Zebras Don't have Ulcers* by Robert M. Sapolsky
- *The Society of Mind* by Marvin Minsky

### Food

Welp, I'm lactose intolerant and allergic to spice. Anything that does not have those two are all good.
